########################### AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations #########################
An AWS Region is a completely separate geographical area that hosts AWS data centers, these data centers are going to have all of the networking gear, power, servers,etc., that run all of your favorite services in the cloud.
Within Regions, you have Availability Zones, and you're going to see it abbreviated very commonly as AZ, these are isolated, independent locations within a specific region with their own redundant power, networking, and low latency connectivity between one another. AZs are made up of several data centers in a specific area, and each AZ is going to be physically separated to reduce the impacts of disasters. Each region contains at least 3 or more AZs.
The next thing is an Edge Location, these are data centers and other telecommunication providers that have their own data centers to help you deliver services with extremely low latency. These are going to allow you to deploy much closer to your end users compared to using Regions and the AZs within them, they leverage what are called Points of Presence in Regional edge caches.
